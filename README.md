Type Wizard
On some platforms, the copy/paste command may not work — but this application does it for you.
Instead of pasting, it types the text for you, key-by-key, just like a human would.

How It Works
Any input you give to this application will be typed automatically by simulating keyboard presses in that exact sequence.


Features
Works even when copy-paste is blocked.

Fully customizable delay and typing speed.

Simple, clean, and easy-to-use interface.

How to Use
Set Delay (in seconds): The time before the typing starts.

Position Cursor: During the delay, move your cursor to where you want the text to be typed.

Set Interval (in sec/10): The pause before pressing each key. (Recommended: 0)

Enter Input Text: The text you want to be typed.

Press the Type Button: The application will type the text automatically.
